# PELA Blocks

See also the [Slicer Recommendations](SLICER_RECOMMENDATIONS) printing information.

## Advanced Setup

Instructions are for Windows, however Linux and OSX are esssentially the same but scripts to automate batch building are not provided.

## Backing Up Your Calibration Files

Copy your calibration files and any .json parameter adjustment files you have created to another directory before update to a newer version of PELA-blocks, you might overwrite your calibration customizations. 

1. `cd PELA-blocks`
1. `cp material.scad ..`
1. `cp *.json ..`

## Sparce Checkout

This saves space on your computer, bandwidth and time. Only the latest version of generated STL and PNG images is kept locally.

1. `git config core.sparcecheckout true`

## Compress and clean STL files from the command line

OpenSCAD exports large text files which 2x larger than binary STL. They may also contain mistakes (non-manifold, etc). Usually your slicer can handle this just fine.

Cleaning and compressing the STL before slicing is optional but may help if you Slicer complains about the file. A quick solution is to load and re-save the file generated by OpenSCAD in [Windows 3D Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrfj3t6) (Open the file, Click `YES` to fix, then `CTRL S` to save over the original file), [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/) or [Meshmixer](http://www.meshmixer.com/download.html).

It is also possible to setup a batch process to clean and re-save multiple `.STL` files using Meshlab. We used to do this but simplified it away as it adds little value. If you know of a better batch tool for cleaning files, please let us know.

## Cleaning up git

To keep the files size down in the repository when many `.stl` and `.png` files start to clutter it, occational cleanup is in the following script which runs on both Linux and Windows.

1. `./gitcleanup.ps1`
