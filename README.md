# PELA Blocks

![ESP8266 d1 miniPro PELA Blocks enclosure](images/d1-miniPro-pela-blocks-enclosure.jpg)

We measured the length, width and thickness of this board. Moving sliders in the customizer graphical interface of the  `PELA Technic Mount` created this functional prototype enclosure with nicely calibrated snap fit connectors. Now we can rapidly iterate our models in the field. 5 minutes plus 30 minutes for printing. This model is saved as a drop down preset of the `PELA Technic Mount` model.

Now you can design models without coding and snap them together!

## LEGO-compatible Parametric 3D Printed Blocks

PELA blocks are designed for easy 3D printing, strength, and rapid customization using free software. One time calibration gives perfect snap-together objects in exotic materials and geometries to help you explore your ideas and build with exotic materials and any motors and electronics you like. Example enclosures with many options for custom sensors, actuators, computers and IoT devices are included, or create your own.

These designs are not by the LEGO corporation. LEGO-compatible blocks are available from multiple manufacturers. Associated basic block patents expired long ago. Press-fit blocks existed before LEGO and we continue that tradition of adapt, evolve and improve as we provide these open source designs for 3D printing.

The name PELA comes from the Finnish "pelataan" meaning "let's play". This [blog post](https://medium.com/@futurice/rapid-hardware-prototyping-turbocharge-your-process-with-pela-blocks-58d0fcff63c5) on how we use these to build a self-driving 1:10 drift car is a good example of rapid prototyping "play".

## Download

**The STL files shown are not calibrated for your printer.** To get a good snap fit with your 3D printer and different material, you need to fine tune the size of knobs, sockets and technic holes. Some starting values are 

1. **[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-blocks/archive/master.zip)** the latest designs, or `git clone git@github.com:paulirotta/PELA-blocks.git`
1. **[Calibrate](#calibrate)** the PELA Block models for your material and printer

See [Advanced Setup](ADVANCED-SETUP.md) for additional tricks.

See the [Slicer Recommendations](SLICER.md) for information about different printing materials we have tested.

## Calibrate

**TL;DR** *: To get a nice snap fit for your printer, slicer settings and material, print a calibration beam and test fit commercial bricks to the top knobs, bottom sockets and side technic holes. Update the best `top_tweak` and `bottom_tweak` into [`material.scad`](material.scad). Now open any model in OpenSCAD, press `F6` to generate the model then `F7` to export an STL.*

[![PELA Example fit of a calibration block](images/PELA-calibration-test-fit-with-LEGO.jpg)](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-blocks/blob/master//PELA-calibration.stl)

There are several possible calibration beams. Most users will want the one linked below unless they are printing with flexible filament.

Test fit the top, bottom and sides to get something which is tight but not too tight. Then update your settings in  [`material.scad`](https://github.com/PELA-Prototypes/parametric-PELA/blob/master/material.scad) then one time calibration is complete.

## OpenSCAD Settings

The software needed is also free and open source, [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/). After install, `Edit | Preferences | Features | Customizer | Enable`. Also for large models and a fast machine, `Edit | Preferences | Advanced | Turn off rendering at _1000000_` and disable `OpenGL 1.0` compatability. 

You can also configure slicing and printing directly from OpenSCAD. See their website for details.

[![PELA Calibration Beam, Normal Filament](/PELA-calibration.png)](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-blocks/blob/master/PELA-calibration.stl)

[PELA Calibration Beam, Normal Filament](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-blocks/blob/master/PELA-calibration.stl) PELA Calibration Beam for standard filament (non-flexible).

### Calibration Instructions

Your printer, slicer settings, and plastic effect the precise fit. To correct for this, we adjust the models slightly for your printing process. Calibration is a one time process for each material. It is as simple as fitting two blocks together and editing a text file, [`material.scad`](material.scad) to indicate which test block fits best.

Before you print the calibration beam, be sure to set the `flexible_material` and `large_nozzle` settings in [`material.scad`](https://github.com/PELA-Prototypes/parametric-PELA/blob/master/material.scad).

After you print the clibration beam, you update three settings to get a tight fit: `top_tweak`, `bottom_tweak` and `axle_hole_tweak`. These can be read from the side of the calibration beam.

1. Print the Calibration Beam and test fit the top knobs and bottom sockets against commercial LEGO. Put the `top_tweak` (on the side, near the top) and `bottom_tweak` (on the side, near the bottom) values that you can read from the side of the beam into `material.scad`.
1. Use OpenSCAD to generate a new 2x2x1 `PELA Block` in OpenSCAD using these new settings, press `F6` to render, and `Export` as `.STL`.
1. Confirm a good fit with both commercial blocks and other PELA Blocks.
1. If you find you also need to adjust the technic connector hole size, print the Calibration Block Set. `axle_hole_tweak` numbers change along with `top_tweak` numbers.
1. Repeat this process as needed when you change material, nozzle size or and slicer settings which affect geometry.

## Advanced Calibration

An alternative set of individual calibration blocks are available, and if you have an unusual material there are other numbers you can tune such as various part thicknesses. See [Advanced Calibration](ADVANCED-CALIBRATION)

## PELA-compatible Part Designs

Edit `material.scad` and `style.scad` to adapt these models before printing them. **The example models below are not yet calibrated for your slicer and printer. Calibrate and then make the tuned model from the .scad file.**

## FFF Printing Tips
§
* Use a 0.4mm or smaller nozzle if possible to avoid decimation of some socket details
* If slicing with Simplify 3D with 0.5mm or larger nozzle, you may want to set Simplify 3D to `Advanced | External Thing Wall Type | Allow single extrusion walls`
* Be aware that slicers may in some cases not be able to correct OpenSCAD STL export errors. These errors should be visible in layer preview as for example extra excursions back to origin. If this happens, open and clean the STL files first with for example Microsoft 3D Builder, Meshmixer or MeshLab. MeshLab command line examples can be found in `build.ps1`.
* Best results are achieved with durable materials that are not too stiff (PET, co-polymers like NGEN, semi-flexible and "engineering" materials instead of PLA and  carbon filled).
* Best results are achieved with smaller nozzle diameters. Adjust slicer settings for precision over speed. Layer height is not particularly important on most models.
* Think carefully before using very slippery materials such as Nylon.
* "standard" and "fast" print setting layer lines are helpful for extra connector grip provided the resulting print geometry is sufficiently accurate.
* A print "brim" the appears inside the model may negatively affect the bottom connector fit
* Leaving the blocks on a heated bed may negatively affect the bottom connector fit

## Resin Printing Tips

* If more than 2 layer tall PELA with a relatively solid interior not allowing drainage below the knobs, check if you need to expand the airhole to allow resin to drain from the flexure chamber inside each knob
* For translucent materials, setting knob_slice_count to 0 may make the interior structure look more like a standard PELA at the cost of a slight reduction of knob sidewall flex

## Alternative 3D Block Designs

If you don't find what you need, consider adding it, contact us or check out the many other excellent design available.

[marian42's excellent online technic part generator](https://marian42.de/partdesigner/) can help you make custom connectors and fixture easily. 

[Yeggi search for LEGO](https://www.yeggi.com/q/lego/)

[Thingiverse Parametric LEGO Group](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/parametric-lego) is an alternate source for these block designs. These designs don't work with the online customizer (speed and complexity, multiple files), so the best path is still to install the newest [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) and **[download](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-blocks/archive/master.zip)** the models.
